# Logistics

For this assignment (and every assignment/lab), you must login into your vagrant Debian 10 VM to complete and test your work. The reason is the examples I will provide below are compiled strictly for that architecture, and this is a consistent architecture where your submission will be graded.  Other environments might work, but the Debian 10 environment is what your code will be evaluated on. 

# Part(s) to this assignment!
